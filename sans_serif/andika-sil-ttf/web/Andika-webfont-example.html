<h1>Using Andika webfonts</h1>

<p>The page demonstrates how to use the WOFF version of Andika for web pages, using local copies of the .woff files in this archive. For more information on this technique - and how to use the normal TrueType version as a web font - see <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/using_web_fonts">Using SIL Fonts on Web Pages</a>.</p>

<p>The body of this document is styled using an external stylesheet, with Andika set as the default font, and loaded directly as a WOFF file using the @font-face rule. If you're seeing a sans-serif font here then it is working. Otherwise the text will be in a serif font or your browser default. This technique should work only in Firefox 3.6+, Chrome 6, the IE9 beta, and in development versions of Safari.</p>
