FONTLOG for Work Sans
---------------------

This file provides detailed information on the Work Sans font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Work Sans fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

‘Work Sans’ fonts are a set of fonts supporting Latin. They are designed for body text and display text on for on-screen reading.

*Note: There are no UFOs as UFOs exported from Glyphs App will currently not generate in Robofont and so on due to using '[Bracket trick](http://www.glyphsapp.com/tutorials/alternating-glyph-shapes)' and '[Brace trick](http://www.glyphsapp.com/tutorials/additional-masters-for-individual-glyphs-the-brace-trick)' to solve interpolation bumps. Glyphs marked orange are bracket layers and glyphs marked yellow are using brace layers.*

There is a Telugu glyph set (Work Sans-Telugu.glyphs) that comes from [Ramabhadra](http://teluguvijayam.org/fonts.html) by Silicon Andhra. Glyphs marked red in the file are those that have been manually cleaned up, the rest are automatically cleaned up with FontForge from Ramabhadra. The Latin glyphs in Work Sans-Telugu.glyphs are out of date.
