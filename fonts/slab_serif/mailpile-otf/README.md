"Mailpile" the font
=============

Our first and only font is called **Mailpile** and was based on the awesome free font Fauna One made by [Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Tunni](http://www.tipo.net.ar/). The goal was to create something closer the slab-serif font [Museo](http://www.exljbris.com/museo.html) which we had used in our branding but were unable to bundle in the Mailpile source code due to a [licensing conflict](http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2013-08-30_Fonts_and_Copyright_Licenses.html).

We were first aided by font master [Richard Fink](http://readableweb.com/) which our designer [Brennan Novak](https://brennannovak.com) refined to it's current state. We also had some amazing help & mentorship from [Vernon Adams](http://www.newtypograph.co.uk/). Lastly, the uber talented [Sveinbjorn Paulsson](http://www.sveinbjorn.com) helped finish off the final touches and made the alternate weights.
