Sorts Mill Goudy
================
_by [Barry Schwartz](http://www.crudfactory.com)_

A 'revival' of Goudy Oldstyle and Italic, with features including small capitals (in the roman only), oldstyle and lining figures, superscripts and subscripts, fractions, ligatures, class-based kerning, case-sensitive forms, and capital spacing. There is support for many languages using latin scripts.
