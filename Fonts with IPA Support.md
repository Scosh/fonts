## Fonts that Have IPA Characters

I'm a linguistics student, so sometimes I need to type strange characters for my homework. This is a quick and dirty list — created mostly for myself and my friends — of fonts in this repository that come with support for the special characters and diacritics of the [International Phonetic Alphabet](http://bit.ly/2bTJT70).

#### Sans-Serif
* Andika
* Deja Vu Sans
* Source Sans Pro

#### Serif
* Charis SIL
* Doulos SIL
* Gentium
* Heuristica
* Junicode
* Lingua Franca

My personal favourites are Source Sans Pro for everything sans and Gentium for serif situations. Lingua Franca isn't quite as pretty, but comes with italics and bold faces, unlike the extended version of Gentium unfortunately. So occasionally Lingua Franca is the more useful font.
