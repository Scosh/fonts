Description?

![specimen](https://github.com/Scosh/fonts/blob/master/typographic-specimen-prototype.png)
The specimen should contain:
- the Latin Alphabet (for now)
- Numbers
- Special Characters
- a pangram
- think about what characters/aspects really interest a typographer, things like the presence of em and en dashes for instance
- how much effort is sensible for this project? Which parts should be outsourced?
