# The Fonts
These guys and gals are hosted here on Github primarilly for my conveniece. However, perhaps you too dear internet person can benefit from this repository's existence: this handpicked selection of typefaces promises to bestow upon your system both open source classics like the **Liberation** and **Deja Vu** fonts as well as the hip and fresh kids everyone is talking about like Mozilla's **Fira**, Adobe's **Source Sans Pro** and Intel's **Clear Sans**. There's also a lot of obscurer stuff to be found here, so why don't you take a gander and see if this pack is to your liking. Most of the fonts are completely open soruce, some are just plain old free as in beer.

## Naming
The fonts are labeled according to the following convention: `format-foundry-typeface`

## Automation
Thanks to my friend [7bitHero](https://github.com/7bitHero) this repo includes a handy makefile that automates and synchronizes these files. This is part of a larger [project](https://github.com/7bitHero/dotfiles) he's currently working on that aims to make sharing and maintaining dotfiles easier on Arch Linux.

I do not claim intellectual ownership of any of this typefaces, I am simply a humble collector and type lover, flabbergasted by the craftsmanship and hard work these wonderful type designers have put into their freely available work. Please refer to the individual fonts for licensing information.
