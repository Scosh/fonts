## Fonts that Have IPA Characters

I'm a Linguistics student, so sometimes I need to type strange characters for my homework. This is a quick and dirty list — created mostly for myself and my friends — of fonts in this repository that come with support for the special characters and diacritics of the [International Phonetic Alphabet](http://bit.ly/2bTJT70).

#### Sans-Serif
* Andika
* Deja Vu Sans
* Fira Sans (doesn't seem to support tone bars?)
* Liberation Sans
* Source Sans Pro (doesn't seem to support tone bars?)
* PT Sans

#### Serif
* Charis SIL
* Doulos SIL
* Gentium Plus
* Heuristica
* Junicode
* Liberation Serif
* Lingua Franca
* PT Serif

#### Monospace
* Fira Mono (doesn't seem to support tone bars?)
* Liberation Mono
* PT Mono
* Source Code Pro

My personal favourites are Source Sans Pro for everything sans and Gentium Plus for serif situations. Lingua Franca isn't quite as pretty, but comes with a bold face, unlike the extended version of Gentium unfortunately. So sometimes Lingua Franca is more convenient.

I've also included the Gentium Basic fonts in this package though. So a possible workaround is for you to use Gentium Basic as the primary typeface in your essay and switch to Gentium Plus whenever you need to type IPA symbols. Kind of silly and annoying… I know, and I haven't tried it yet myself, so I don't know how consistent it looks, but perhaps worth a shot.

If you want to know more about the differences between Gentium Plus and Gentium Basic aswell as Andika and Andika New Basic, you can read [this](http://software.sil.org/gentium/support/faq/) and [this](http://software.sil.org/andika/support/faq/).

I'm also gonna use this chance to reveal the not-so-secret crush I have for SIL for making Gentium, the serif font that flows through my veins, and for writing the OFL… the wonderful, wonderful OFL!
