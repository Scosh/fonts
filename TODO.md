### To Do
- create a separate branch of this repository without any specimen images and readmes
- design header image: "The Fantastic Font Pack of Open Source Goodness"
- research foundry names again, re-evaluate labelling method
- come up with an efficient, good looking and consistent way of adding source information and specimens
- remove duplicate font files (like having both otf and ttf versions of a fonts in a family)
- set up (ideally automatically) updating git repositories for viable fonts in the master branch, so font files are as recent as possible

### Doing
- include specimen images & SOURCE.MD readmes
- add more cool fonts
- sort out lame fonts

### Done
- Reverse labelling convention: `typeface-foundry-format`?
- Test makefile
- clean project to only include open source typefaces
